A microwave oven manufacturer recommends that when heating two items, add 50% to the heating time, and when heating three items double the heating time. Heating more than three items at once is not recommended. Write a program that asks the user for the number of items and the single-item heating time. The program then writes out the recommended heating time.

n=int(input('Enter the number of items \n'))
i=float(input('Enter the single item heating time \n'))
if(n==1):
    print('The recommended heating time is','%.2f'%i)
elif(n==2):
    print('The recommended heating time is','%.2f'%(1.5*i))
else:
    print('Number of items is more')
