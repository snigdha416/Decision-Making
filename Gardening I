Dora is interested so much in gardening and she plants more trees in her garden. She plants trees in a rectangular fashion with the order of rows and columns and numbered the trees in row-wise order. She planted the mango tree only in a 1st row, 1st column and last column. So given the tree number, your task is to find whether the given tree is a mango tree or not? Write a program to check whether the given number is a mango tree or not. 

R=int(input())
C=int(input())
N=int(input())
if(N>=1) and (N<R):
    print("Yes")
elif N%C==0:
    print("Yes")
elif N%C==1:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
